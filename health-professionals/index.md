The WA Lyme Association (WALA) is holding two Lyme Awareness seminars for health professionals in East Perth (25 October) and Bridgetown (29 November). 

Please view or download the [practitioner information brochure](/media/Lyme-MSIDS Information for Health Practitioners.pdf) and [invitation flyer](/media/Lyme-MSIDS Seminar Invitation Flyer.pdf) for these seminars.

Bookings can be made at [wala.eventbrite.com.au](http://wala.eventbrite.com.au).

As WALA is still in the process of developing this new website, we have yet to upload a comprehensive information section for health practitioners but will endeavour to expand the information available on this link in coming months.

In the interim, health professionals are encouraged to view the [Information for Doctors](http://www.lymedisease.org.au/for-doctors/) section on the Lyme Disease Association of Australia (LDAA) website.
