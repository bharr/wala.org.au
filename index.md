*Welcome to our brand new web site.  Please bear with us while our volunteers further develop the site.*
  
In excess of 500 cases of Lyme disease have already been diagnosed in Western Australia and thousands more throughout Australia. Despite this, the condition has yet to receive official recognition from the Australian government and medical community.   Very few Australian doctors are prepared to diagnose and treat Lyme disease, treatment is expensive and the only support services available for patients are provided by other Lyme patients.
  
The Western Australian Lyme Association (WALA) was founded by patients in August 2012 with the intention of providing peer support, information sharing, facilitating relevant research and advocating toward policy change for Lyme disease, more aptly described as Multi-systemic Infectious Disease Syndrome (MSIDS).

#### Health Professionals

The WA Lyme Association (WALA) is holding two Lyme Awareness seminars for health professionals in East Perth (25 October) and Bridgetown (29 November). 

Please view or download the [practitioner information brochure](/media/Lyme-MSIDS Information for Health Practitioners.pdf) and [invitation flyer](/media/Lyme-MSIDS Seminar Invitation Flyer.pdf) for these seminars.

Bookings can be made at [wala.eventbrite.com.au](http://wala.eventbrite.com.au).

As WALA is still in the process of developing this new website, we have yet to upload a comprehensive information section for health practitioners but will endeavour to expand the information available on this link in coming months.

In the interim, health professionals are encouraged to view the [Information for Doctors](http://www.lymedisease.org.au/for-doctors/) section on the Lyme Disease Association of Australia (LDAA) website.
