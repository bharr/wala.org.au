In excess of 500 cases of Lyme disease have already been diagnosed in Western Australia and thousands more throughout Australia. Despite this, the condition has yet to receive official recognition from the Australian government and medical community.   Very few Australian doctors are prepared to diagnose and treat Lyme disease, treatment is expensive and the only support services available for patients are provided by other Lyme patients.
  
The Western Australian Lyme Association (WALA) was founded by patients in August 2012 with the intention of providing peer support, information sharing, facilitating relevant research and advocating toward policy change for Lyme disease, more aptly described as Multi-systemic Infectious Disease Syndrome (MSIDS).
