The Western Australian Lyme Association (WALA) was founded by patients in August 2012 with the intention of providing peer support, information sharing, facilitating relevant research and advocating toward policy change for Lyme disease, more aptly described as Multi-systemic Infectious Disease Syndrome (MSIDS). 

## Purpose
WALA has provided services to over 200 individuals in the Lyme community in the past two years and continues to offer the following:

#### Peer support 
WALA provides peer support to patients suffering from Lyme disease or MSIDS via a telephone counselling service, email contact, two Facebook sites and occasional social gatherings. 

#### Information sharing 
WALA’s primary vehicles for sharing information about Lyme disease have been its two Facebook groups.  These are the [WA Lyme Association Public Information Page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/294413407330684) and a [Private Discussion Room](https://www.facebook.com/groups/211187529049117/) (for patients only).

WALA also emails out occasional newsletters and news updates to its members. To subscribe to these updates, please sign up [on the contact page]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact).

With the launch of this website, WALA hopes to be able to expand its capacity to share even more information to a wider audience as the site is further developed.

#### Advocacy and Lyme disease awareness
WALA members were major contributors to the national patient task force that prepared the Lyme Disease Association of Australia LDAA’s 63-page [formal submission](http://www.lymedisease.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/20140129LDAAScopingStudyResponse.pdf) in response to the Scoping Study Report commissioned as part of the [Chief Medical Officer’s review of Lyme disease in Australia](http://www.health.gov.au/lyme-disease).  In addition, WALA prepared a shorter [complementary submission](http://www.lymedisease.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/WALAScopingStudySubmission.pdf) raising issues more specifically related to Western Australia. 

WALA took a lead role in developing the [Patient-focused Action Plan](http://www.lymedisease.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/20140129LDAAPatientStrategicActionPlan.pdf) that was appended to the LDAA’s submission to the CMO to provide government and medical authorities with a strategic blue print for addressing the Lyme disease problem in Australia.

WALA contributed significantly to the national media campaign for the Australian Worldwide Lyme Awareness Project (WWLAP) in May 2014 by preparing media releases and a [Media Information Kit](http://www.lymedisease.org.au/media/) hosted on the LDAA website. WALA’s local media campaign in Western Australia resulted in more than a dozen print articles in state and suburban publications as well as several radio programs.

#### Research 

WALA has identified much of the controversy surrounding ‘Lyme disease’ in Australia arises from a lack of adequate research into the Multi-systemic Infectious Disease Syndrome being experienced by patients.
