  <h4>
    A voice for Lyme-like disease in Western Australia.
  </h4>
  <p>
  In excess of 500 cases of Lyme Disease have been diagnosed in Western
  Australia in the past three years. Despite this, the condition has yet to
  receive official recognition from the Australian government and medical
  community. The WA Lyme Association was founded by patients in August 2012
  with the intention of providing peer support, information sharing,
  facilitating relevant research and advocating toward policy change for Lyme
  Disease.
